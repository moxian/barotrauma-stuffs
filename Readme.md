A collection(?) of tools to extract info from barotrauma game files and present it in a readable format.

Code quality is horrible (because the source data is inconsistent, because human-friendly presentation has myriad of edge cases and is hard, and of course because i wrote it as a one-shot with no intent of maintaining). Contributing is not welcome.

This exists on github only to potentially regenerate autogenerated pages for the baro wiki.
